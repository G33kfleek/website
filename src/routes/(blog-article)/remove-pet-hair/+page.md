Pet hair can be a persistent nuisance, especially on upholstered furniture. Fortunately, there are several effective methods to remove pet hair and keep your home looking and feeling clean.

## Top Methods to Remove Pet Hair from Upholstery

### 1. Use a Rubber Glove

One of the simplest ways to remove pet hair is by using a rubber glove. The friction created by the rubber helps to loosen and lift the hair from the fabric.

**Steps:**
1. **Put on a Rubber Glove**: Use a damp rubber glove for better results.
2. **Rub the Fabric**: Run your hand over the upholstery in a sweeping motion. The hair will clump together, making it easier to collect.

2. **Replace Sheets as Needed**: When the sheets become full, replace them with a fresh one to continue removing hair.
